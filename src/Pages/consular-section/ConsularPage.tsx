                    <p className="">
                        The government of Kenya established the Huduma Kenya Program to transform service delivery to ensure citizens are provided with convenient, dignifying, quick and excellent services using one-stop shop services delivery models; both physical and electronic. These are platforms where various government services are provided from one place a customer need not move anywhere else to receive these services.
                    </p>
                    <p className="">
                        To date the program has established 46 Huduma Centers: a Huduma Contact Centre; Huduma Mobile Services and the Huduma Smart Servie Card. The e-Huduma Portal is still under development. These platforms have had tremendous success and are very popular with citizens. As a result, the program has received multiple awards locally, continentally and globally.

                    <p className="">
                        The government now plans to accord the same experience to Kenyan citizens living abroad and any other nationalities interested in specific services from Kenya. To do this, the government needs to understand the nature of services these customers require and how these may be provided based on the Huduma Kenya model of one-stop shop service delivery platforms. To this end, the diapora community and other nationalities interested in services by Kenya are requested to fill the questionnaire below and send it to {" "}

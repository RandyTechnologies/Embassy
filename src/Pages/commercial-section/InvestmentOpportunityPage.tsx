                <p>Investment opportunities in Kenya:</p>
                <p className="font-bold my-4">Agriculture</p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    This sector generates the highest foreign exchange earnings for the country and employs about 75% of the population and contributes about 30% of the GDP. Tea is the highest foreign exchange earner, followed by horticulture and coffee. Investment opportunities are available in the areas of large-scale plantations,  processing and marketing of agricultural products, such as avocados and pineapples. Others are cotton, pyrethrum, sugar and oil crops. The main oil crops are coconut, cashew nuts, Soya beans, groundnuts, macadamia, sunflower and cotton seeds. Investment is also possible in the sisal and flax sub-sectors. Gum-Arabic and herbal teas such as camomile and hibiscus are profitable agricultural resources in Kenya which potential investors can fully exploit
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Investment opportunities in the livestock sub-sector includes camel farming, production and marketing of canned and fermented meats, provision of superior breeding stock, leather tanning, rearing of wild animal and game meat production, e.g. ostrich and crocodile farming, production of chicken stock birds, milk and butter production, honey refining and production of allied inputs e.g. feeds for livestock and poultry, equipment and machinery etc.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Governments policy for the fisheries sub-sector has been to maximize production by proper utilization of resources. Most of fishing activities are concentrated in Lake Victoria and the coastal area along the Indian Ocean.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Fish production in Kenya as an investment opportunity can be increased by promoting sustainable capture fisheries in lakes, rivers and the ocean. Secondly opportunities are also available in culture fisheries on farmlands. Conditions for fish farming are readily available in Kenya.There are three types of fish farming practices in Kenya which an investor could exploit for local and export market. These are warm water fish farming (suitable for tilapia, bass, and common carp; cold mountain fish farming (suitable for trout), and saline water (coastal fishing farming (shrimps). Kenya welcomes investors in the fish processing plants, deep sea fishing, and fish farming among other areas.

                    Tourism
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Kenya is indisputably a safari country of repute and tourism is a key foreign exchange earner. Kenya’s early tourist visitors may be claimed as far back as 28th February 1498 when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama landed at Malindi, the Indian Ocean coastal town on the explorer’s trip to India around the southern African coast.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Kenya’s natural vegetation and rich fauna provide a feast of diversity. At present Kenya has a total of 59 national parks, reserves and sanctuaries offering the visitors the opportunity to view the “big five” – lion, elephant, rhino, leopard and buffalo. Main safaris include Wildlife, sports , scenic, culture, beach, adventure, specialist and business including conference tourism. <br />
                    On investment opportunities, Kenya has a wide range of potential tourist attractions which can be exploited by foreign investors. Currently tourism investment is mainly concentrated along the coastal region of the country and the savannah lands with the national parks and game reserves. Regional diversification to help exploit the vast potential of tourist products is being undertaken to include other circuits in the country. The potential for the domestic market has also not been exploited. A need to identify diverse tourist attractions other than the existing game parks also offer investment opportunity.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Specific investment opportunities are available in establishment of identified 3 major tourism resorts at the coast and northern Kenya,  eco-tourism, cruise ship in the coast and Lake Victoria, amusement parks in major cities, airport hotels in major airports, health spa projects, and lodges in several game parks, among others.

                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Physical infrastructure is an important prerequisite in creating and supporting a business environment that facilitates private sector investment, job creation, economic development and growth. The provision of adequate infrastructure and services is therefore, necessary to achieve the country’s industrialisation as targeted for by the year 2030. The sub-sectors in the infrastructure segment of the economy include roads, rail, air, maritime and inland water transportation systems, as well as energy.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Kenya has a road network of about 177,800 km out of which only 63,575 km is classified. The classified road network has increased from 41,800 km at independence to 63,575 km today. During the same period, the paved road length grew from 1,811 km to 9,273 km. It is presently estimated that about 70% (44,100 km) of the classified road network is in good condition and is maintainable while the remaining 30% (18,900 km) requires rehabilitation or reconstruction.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Railway network in Kenya has stagnated since the initial construction. There are currently 2597 km total rail network in Kenya of which 1738 km are public lines and 859 km of private line and sidings. Investment requirements in the sub-sector involve infrastructure development and expansion including the proposed high capacity standard gauge network, the greater Nairobi Commuter Services and the Mombasa and Kisumu Commuter Rail Services

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Maritime transport is a low cost means of moving heavy and bulky freight. Kenya, due to her ocean frontage and Lake Victoria, serves the eastern and central African hinterlands e.g. Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Southern Sudan and Northern-eastern Tanzania.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
